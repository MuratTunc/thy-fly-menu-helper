# Flight Menu Web Application


In this study, the aim is to enable passengers to see the information written on the meal menu information cards distributed to users before the meal service during the flight in their own language on the phone. With this, it will be possible for them to adjust the meal menu according to their own health conditions and personal preferences by communicating with the smart assistant in the application running on the browser on the phone.
